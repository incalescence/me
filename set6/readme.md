## Week 6

During flex-week, I took the time to explore the dataset I collected on Tiktok user's and music and explore it more. Despite the data being very relevant to popular culture the numerical data did not mean much as there was not a lot of variation between video lengths, noise frequencies and video qualities. The information was not helpful to making a judgement about the data and making a popular Tiktok. I learnt more about the Tiktok algorithm and there are many aspects such as location, age and gender which may skew which videos have been reccommended as trending for me, thus the data experiment i planned is not scientifically valid to carry out.

I began brainstorming more questions I have and one was about home ownership in Sydney as it covers many aspects which I can look into. Mortgage, social economic divides in different areas of Sydney, income increases which I can look into and make a judgement about.
