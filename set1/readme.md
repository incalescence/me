## Week 1

Today we went through setting up git, GitHub and making a stack overflow account - There was a lot of admin involved in setting up a programming environment.

The course, CODE1161 is an interesting course as it explores relationships between computation, design and architecture.

One thing that really stood out to me in the lecture was the value placed on the importance of culture and how programming and science is intertwined with culture.

I am keen to explore data visualisation and explain trends and predict data patterns through the open data project later in the term.
