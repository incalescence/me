## Week 5

In the lecture this week we went through the history of computing and discussed the contribution of famous people such as Lovelace and Turing. It is astonishing how fast technology and computing has developed in the past century.

The lab exercises went through using input/output and was helpful for completing the lab exercises. I continued to look for a dataset for the open data project and found inspiration through watching the presentations from past years. I found that the presentations that particularly stood out had a narrative component to the presentation; using the data to tell a story. I am interested in social media trends and think that data in that area is interesting to research. There is not a lot of data on public government sites relating to social media, so I might have to access my own data through using APIs.
