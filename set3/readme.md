## Week 3

This week was a public holiday and I was not able to make the make up class so I watched the recording. The exercises were pretty straightforward and going through the examples covered in the lectures really helped me to understand the content.

I began looking for potential data sets to document and research for the open data project. Some of the key things I'm looking for is quantitative data and data that includes geographical locations as this would be nice to graph using the pandas library.
