## Week 2

This week, in the lecture we went through many tools used in Python programming from declaring variables to data structures such as lists and dictionaries. Furthermore, we went through programming methods such as if statements and while loops. 

I think it is really vital to be detail oriented when it comes to programming as it is easy to be confused between ; and : or . and ,
As Ben mentioned having good and healthy habits when programming is very important and that looks like taking breaks, getting enough rest, eating healthily etc.
