## Week 8

This week we went through plotting maps with the special python library Geopandas. Although it was quite finnicky to get set up, using mapsto visualize geographic data is a really clear and correct way of representing information. \
I want to incorporate the strategies we learnt in class this week to my own data project and the first step for me next is to plot the location of the train stations in Sydney.\
I find that a good way to find the longitude and latitude of geographic data is converting an address from google maps.
